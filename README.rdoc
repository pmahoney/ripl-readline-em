== Description

Run EventMachine code in a ripl shell asynchronously with readline
editing and completion.  Uses FFI to access the alternate Readline
callback interface.

== Install
Install the gem with:

    gem install ripl-readline-em

== Usage

    require 'eventmachine'
    require 'ripl/readline/em'
    
    EventMachine.run do
      EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(2) do
        # Example of writing output while line is being edited.
        #
        # See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1512028/gnu-readline-how-do-clear-the-input-line
        print "\b \b" * Readline.line_buffer.size
        print "\r"
        begin
          puts "#{Time.now}"
        ensure
          Readline.forced_update_display
        end
      end
    
      # Start up Ripl, but it will not receive any user input
      Ripl.start
    
      # Watch stdin for input, sending it to Ripl as entered (including editing,
      # history and completion).
      #
      # Default behavior is to call EventMachine.stop_event_loop when the shell is
      # exited.  Modify this behavior by passing a hash with an `:on_exit` entry,
      # either nil or a Proc that will be run on exit instead of the default.
      EventMachine.watch_stdin Ripl::Readline::EmInput
    
      # -or-
      # EventMachine.watch_stdin Ripl::Readline::EmInput, :on_exit => nil
    
      # Yet another option is to create your own handler module, include
      # Ripl::Readline::EmInput, and override the `on_exit` method.
    end
